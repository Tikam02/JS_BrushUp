React is the library for creating views. ReactDOM is the library used
to actually render the UI in the browser.


### React Elements
HTML is simply a set of instructions that a browser follows when constructing the
DOM. The elements that make up an HTML document become DOM elements
when the browser loads HTML and renders the user interface.
